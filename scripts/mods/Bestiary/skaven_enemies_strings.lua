In lean times, they themselves become the food.\n\nThe majority of slaves are Skaven born into bondage of the lowest class of a hierarchical society. Their ranks swell as rival clans are captured during internecine wars. Even non-Skaven become slaves, although few other races last long under the whips of the ratmen overseers.\n\n\nThe life of a Skavenslave is cruel, but mercifully short. Food is so rare that cannibalism is the way of life and each day is a battle for survival. A slave with the slightest injury is hungrily marked by his pack.\n\n\nIn warfare Skavenslaves are used en masse to absorb missile fire and to overwhelm the enemy with numbers. A common Warlord tactic is to whip Skavenslaves to the fore of an assault. Many are butchered, but the loss is acceptable if the slaves bear the brunt of the incoming arrows or tire the foe for the next attack wave. Slaves who break in battle are shown no mercy and are simply trampled underfoot by the next oncoming wave."

During their recruitment and training they receive better food, equipment and training, creating superior warriors who are bigger, stronger, tougher and braver than the typical Clanrat warriors.\n\n\nThe Stormvermin are important assets to their Warlord, who will provide them with preferential treatment to the rank-and-file Clanrats (typically by ensuring that they are firstfed after battle).\n\nWhile Clanrats carry spears, rotten shields and wear scraps of metal, Stormvermin are commonly equipped with better armour  and wield heavy-bladed halberds.\n\nThe Stormvermin are commonly employed as guards by their leaders, watching over important Skaven or securing private areas of their warrens.\n\nIn war, Stormvermin regiments provide the Warlords with crack troops, well-equipped to spearhead assaults."
