A lone Clanrat is rarely a threat to any but the least experienced opponent.
However, in numbers, Clanrats swarm their enemies in a chittering horde  stabbing, biting, and clawing their enemies to a swift and brutal death. 

Mainly due to cowardice and lack of discipline, lone Clanrats are not formidable opponents except when they are attacking a weakened or crippled enemy, preferably from the shadows.

Banded together in large numbers, however, they are ferocious warriors, attacking without hesitation even against obviously superior enemies. 


The Clanrats do their part to ensure the Skaven hierarchy is maintained, keeping down the class below them (namely the Skavenslaves), while profusely humbling themselves before those of the ranks above them."

Skavenslaves perform all menial tasks, including mining, tunnelling, and food production. In lean times, they themselves become the food. 

The majority of slaves are Skaven born into bondage of the lowest class of a hierarchical society. Their ranks swell as rival clans are captured during internecine wars. Even non-Skaven become slaves, although few other races last long under the whips of the ratmen overseers. 


The life of a Skavenslave is cruel, but mercifully short. Food is so rare that cannibalism is the way of life and each day is a battle for survival. A slave with the slightest injury is hungrily marked by his pack. 


In warfare Skavenslaves are used en masse to absorb missile fire and to overwhelm the enemy with numbers. A common Warlord tactic is to whip Skavenslaves to the fore of an assault. Many are butchered, but the loss is acceptable if the slaves bear the brunt of the incoming arrows or tire the foe for the next attack wave. Slaves who break in battle are shown no mercy and are simply trampled underfoot by the next oncoming wave"

Pure white or grey fur and distinctive horns mark Grey Seers, who are perhaps the most powerful and mysterious individuals in the whole of a Skaven army. 

The potent mage-rats travel the Under-Empire seeking to coordinate and unite the bickering clans, as well as, furthering their own sinister plans of advancement. 

The solitary Grey Seers are the mysterious binders of the Skaven race, always seeking to pull the feuding clans along in some interwoven, but never fully revealed, scheme.

When thrown, the sphere shatters, releasing billowing clouds so lethal that mere skin contact can cause severe pain or even death. 

Globadiers wear elaborate masks, goggles, and cumbersome breathing apparatuses in order to protect themselves from their own gas, and Clan Skryre are rich enough to equip them with heavier armour than that worn by clanrats.

Other clans are sometimes suspicious of this, though the desire to possess packs of specially-trained war beasts is usually enough to overcome any qualms. 


Skaven Packmasters drive ravening packs of beasts into battle, using whips and intimidation in order to spur their charges into a fury of teeth and claws, These beasts includes swarms of rats, mutated Giant rats, and horrific Rat-Ogres of every description. 

The Packmaster displays no fear of the beasts they control, for to do so is to invite the beasts to turn on them. Even so, no beast is entirely predictable and even a veteran Packmaster runs the constant risk of dying beneath his charges' teeth and claws."

These Skaven often make up a military elite called the Stormvermin. During their recruitment and training they receive better food, equipment and training, creating superior warriors who are bigger, stronger, tougher and braver than the typical Clanrat warriors. 


The Stormvermin are important assets to their Warlord, who will provide them with preferential treatment to the rank-and-file Clanrats (typically by ensuring that they are firstfed after battle). 

While Clanrats carry spears, rotten shields and wear scraps of metal, Stormvermin are commonly equipped with better armour  and wield heavy-bladed halberds. 

The Stormvermin are commonly employed as guards by their leaders, watching over important Skaven or securing private areas of their warrens.

Some time ago, he personally machinated a devious plot to poison and mutate the gathered leadership of Ubersreik at the annual Grand Masquerade. His plan was thwarted by adventurers, and the backlash was severe. Rasknitt had to relocate and start his world domination scheme all over. 


But the Horned Rat must have favoured Rasknitt, because an opportunity of a lifetime stumbled his way when he made contact with the weakened Clan Fester. Rasknitt threw himself head over hind-paw into a game of trickery and deceit, and wound up as the commander of the assault on Ubersreik. 

Fester is a weakened clan, ravaged by disease and out of favour with the mighty Clan Pestilens. Rasknitt has convinced the Warlord of Clan Fester that only he can deliver a cure for the sickness ravaging Clan Fester. The disease has been named the Brood Blight, and it's crippling the clan by afflicting the clan's Breeders, reducing their fertility rates and quality of their offspring.

The first step to provide the cure for the Brood Blight, claims Rasknitt, is to conquer and enslave the man-thing nest of Ubersreik."
